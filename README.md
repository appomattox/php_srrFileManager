php_srrFileManager
==================

== DESCRIPTION ==

A simple PHP script of less than 100kb which help you to list, add, edit, move, delete, rename, search, etc files and directories. It doesn't need a database, so it's fast to "install" and use :)

It contain several languages interface: english, catalan, castillian (spanish), germany.
It contain two skins for style displaying: mint, night.


== INSTALLATION ==

1. Simply create a folder within the directory that you wants to "explore" and put inside these files

2. edit the a_users array in the $config variable for specify a username, password and "filefolder" (read below before use it)


== USERS & FOLDERS ==

- in the array a_users you can add as users as you need
- each one has permission to access to the files/directories contained under the "filefolder" directory that you specify for them
- this "filefolder" usually take the value: ../ (will give access to the parent directory to the container of this script)
- so, briefly: the "filefolder" is a RELATIVE path !

- Note: in the downloaded package you will find the directory "tmp" which is only for development purpose, so it is not necesary for the script, and you can delete it.


== PROBLEMS ==

- if you have problems for move, edit, upload, etc... probably is due to a problem with permissions:

 + perhaps the owner of the script is not the necesary for read/write the files
 + or perhaps the files you need read/write has quite low permissions, so you must to increase it


== SECURITY ==

- this tool is very dangerous for be accessed by bad people, so although it use cookies for login, it's recommendable that you take one of these measures:

 + if you can is better that you access the script using SSL certificate (https://)
 + upload this script only when you need it and after delete it
 + possibly the best option is this: put the script inside a directory protected with user/password through Apache directory protection
